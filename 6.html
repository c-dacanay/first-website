    <p>
      A roleplaying forum focused on literacy and open storytelling.<br />
      S*T was run and organized by a group of 14-20 year olds. <br />In 2003 it was
      the #1 roleplaying forum according to Neopet's Anime Guild and had around
      11k active members.
      <br />

    <p>
      I was an active member, moderator, and eventually admin at 13.
      <br />
      It was a corner of the internet that really belonged to us. <br />(don't
      give a 13 year old admin privileges to anything though)<br />
