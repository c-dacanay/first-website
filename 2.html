    <h1>LiveJournal <br />
      1999 - </h1>
    <p>
      Livejournal, or LJ, was a social networking site connected by diary-like
      blogs. <br />It had thriving creative communities where many authors and
      comic artists built audiences for their work.<br /></p><p></p>
      I had 4 journals: three for my online friends, and one for my
      school friends.<br />Only one remains public, and all entries are physically painful to read.<br />
